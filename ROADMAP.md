# Gibbon Framework Development Roadmap

## Overview
Gibbon is a lightweight Scala library for building production-ready, backpressure-aware, stateful, event-time-correct streaming pipelines that can run locally for development or across a cluster.

## Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)

### 1.1 Project Setup & Dependencies
- [x] Add Akka Streams dependency to build.sbt
- [x] Add Akka HTTP for REST endpoints
- [x] Add Circe for JSON serialization
- [x] Add Logback for logging
- [X] Set up basic project structure

### 1.2 Core Abstractions
- [x] Define `Event` trait as base for all events
- [x] Create `Source` abstraction for event producers
- [x] Create `Flow` abstraction for event processors
- [x] Create `Sink` abstraction for event consumers
- [x] Define `Pipeline` trait for chaining components

### 1.3 Basic Infrastructure
- [X] Create `EventContext` for metadata (timestamp, partition, offset)
- [X] Implement `EventStore` for stateful operations
- [X] Create `MetricsCollector` for monitoring
- [X] Set up basic error handling framework

## Phase 2: Core Components (Weeks 3-4)

### 2.1 Built-in Sources
- [X] `FileSource` - read events from files
- [X] `KafkaSource` - read from Kafka topics
- [X] `HttpSource` - receive events via HTTP
- [X] `GeneratorSource` - generate test events

### 2.2 Built-in Flows
- [X] `FilterFlow` - filter events based on predicates
- [X] `TransformFlow` - transform event structure
- [X] `EnrichFlow` - add additional data to events
- [X] `WindowFlow` - aggregate events in time windows
- [X] `JoinFlow` - join events from multiple streams

### 2.3 Built-in Sinks
- [X] `FileSink` - write events to files
- [X] `KafkaSink` - write to Kafka topics
- [X] `HttpSink` - send events via HTTP
- [X] `ConsoleSink` - print events to console
- [X] `DatabaseSink` - persist events to database

## Phase 2.5: Delivery system that allows users to choose between akka and pekko

- [X] Create runtime abstraction and Akka implementation
- [X] Create runtime abstraction and Pekko implementation
- [X] Update all core components to use runtime abstraction
- [X] Add auto-detection and migration utilities
- [X] Update docs and examples


## Phase 3: Advanced Features (Weeks 5-6)

### 3.1 State Management

## Implementation Priority Matrix

### High Priority (Must Have)
- Basic sources, flows, and sinks
- Error handling and recovery
- Simple monitoring and metrics
- Documentation and examples

### Medium Priority (Should Have)
- Advanced windowing and aggregation
- State management and checkpointing
- Configuration management
- Testing framework

### Low Priority (Nice to Have)
- Machine learning integration
- Visual pipeline designer
- Multi-cluster support
- IDE plugins

## Success Criteria

### Performance Targets
- Process 100K+ events/second per node
- Sub-second latency for simple pipelines
- 99.9% uptime in production
- Linear scalability up to 10 nodes

### Developer Experience
- Simple API with minimal boilerplate
- Comprehensive error messages
- Fast startup time (< 5 seconds)
- Easy debugging and monitoring

### Production Readiness
- Full observability and monitoring
- Graceful error handling
- Hot configuration reloading
- Zero-downtime deployments

## Next Steps

1. Start with Phase 1.1 - set up dependencies and basic structure
2. Create a simple proof-of-concept pipeline
3. Iterate based on feedback and requirements
4. Gradually add more sophisticated features
5. Focus on developer experience and documentation

Remember: Start simple, iterate often, and always keep the end user in mind.
